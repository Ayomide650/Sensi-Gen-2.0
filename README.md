## Database Schema

### user_credentials
```sql
- user_id (uuid, primary key)
- username (text, unique)
- password_hash (text)
- role (text) -- 'user', 'vip', 'admin'
- generations_today (integer)
- last_generation_date (date)
- created_at (timestamp)
- vip_expires_at (timestamp, nullable)
```

### device_reviews
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (uuid, foreign key)
- device_name (text)
- rating (integer, 1-5)
- comment (text, nullable)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sensi-gen-freefire.git
cd sensi-gen-freefire
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Update the URL and API key in `src/lib/supabase.ts`
   - Run the database migrations

4. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

The app is configured for GitHub Pages deployment:

1. Push to the main branch
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy
3. Access your site at `https://yourusername.github.io/sensi-gen-freefire`

## Device Database

The device database is initially empty and should be populated with device specifications:

```typescript
export const deviceDatabase: DeviceDatabase = {
  "iPhone 15 Pro": {
    screenSize: 6.1,
    refreshRate: 120,
    touchSamplingRate: 240,
    processorScore: 95,
    gpuScore: 94,
    releaseYear: 2023,
    ram: 8,
    brand: "Apple"
  },
  // Add more devices...
};
```

## Sensitivity Algorithm

The sensitivity calculation considers:
- Device screen size and refresh rate
- Touch sampling rate
- Processor and GPU performance scores
- User play style and experience level
- Device age and optimization factors
